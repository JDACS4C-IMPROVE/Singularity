    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The [IMPROVE Project](https://jdacs4c-improve.github.io/docs/index.html) focus on data standardization/quality/integration for a variety of cancer drug response problems. The intention with this example is to show how to modify such an example to comply with the [IMPROVE library:](https://github.com/JDACS4C-IMPROVE/IMPROVE). See the [Unified Interface Documentation](https://jdacs4c-improve.github.io/docs/content/unified_interface.html) \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This model does not use any of the cancer data, it simply classifies images of clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset into 10 categories:\n",

    "\n",
    "Preprocessing\n",
    "Training\n",
    "Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using PyTorch's torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST class.\n",
    "Split the data into training and validation sets.\n",
    "Normalize pixel values to a range of [0, 1] and ensure them to have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of 0.5.\n",
    "This helps stabilize the training process and improve model convergence.\n",
    "Use torchvision.datasets.FashionMNIST with ``Download=True`` to download the dataset locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Training\n",
    "This section assumes that the data has been preprocessed and is available for training.\n",
    "We first define a neural network architecture suitable for image classification (e.g., a convolutional neural network).\n",
    "Instantiate the model with PyTorch's torch.nn modules.\n",
    "Select a loss function: cross-entropy loss. Choose the optimizer SGD to update model parameters during training.\n",
    "Iterate through training data in batches for a fixed number of epochs:\n",
    "Feed a batch of images and labels to the model.\n",
    "Calculate the loss based on the model's predictions and true labels.\n",
    "Backpropagate the loss to update model parameters using the optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the trained model's state.\n",
    "For new, unseen images:\n",
    "Preprocess them as done during training.\n",
    "Pass the preprocessed images through the model to compute predictions and compare with the ground truth labels.\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the code for specific model architecture, hyperparameter choices, and implementation choices."
